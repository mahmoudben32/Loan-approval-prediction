# Introduction:
This project aims to automate the loan qualifying procedure for a company based on information provided by customers while filling out an online application form. The goal is to develop machine learning (ML) models that can predict loan approval, thereby accelerating the decision-making process for determining whether a person is eligible for a loan or not.

# Objectives of the Notebook ðŸ“Œ
Main Goals
Analyze customer data provided in the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
Build various ML models that can predict loan approval.
Project Structure

## 1. Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Understand the structure and characteristics of the data.
Identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.
Visualize key insights using graphs and charts.

## 2. Model Building

### Preprocessing:
Clean the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Model Training:
Train different ML models ( Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).
Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.

### Model Evaluation:
Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
Compare the performance of different models to select the best one.


### Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.
